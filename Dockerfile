# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.6
#
# Multi-stage Dockerfile for aios. Two deploy targets share most of the
# image:
#
#   docker build --target api    -t aios-api    .
#   docker build --target worker -t aios-worker .
#
# Coolify points two Applications at this same Dockerfile with different
# `--target` values. When api/worker eventually split into separate repos,
# each takes the `base` + its own stage into a slimmer per-repo Dockerfile;
# the split is mechanical at that point.

# stages inherit it) that `GET /health` echoes back. This makes the truthful
# running SHA verifiable over pure HTTPS — `fleet --drift` only sees Coolify's
# deploy-queue commit (build INTENT), which can silently diverge from a
# zombie/failed-deploy container, and reading the real SHA otherwise needs SSH
# (often blocked). Empty when built without the arg (e.g. local `docker build`);
# `/health` then reports "unknown". See issue #1669.

# Docker, not Docker-in-Docker.

# Liveness check: the worker process touches /var/run/aios-worker-alive
# every 15 s once it's fully started (lock acquired, pool open,
# procrastinate consuming jobs). A stale or missing file means the
# worker is hung, crashlooping, or still in startup — all "unhealthy"
# from an orchestrator's point of view.
#
# Why a file instead of a TCP listener or DB query: the worker has no
# HTTP surface, and a DB-touching healthcheck would impose a per-check
# query on Postgres for a signal a ``aios.worker.heartbeat`` log line
# could equally provide. tmpfs writes are essentially free.
#
# The 60 s threshold = 4× the heartbeat interval; tolerates a few
# missed beats from slow event loops without flapping. ``start-period``
# of 60 s covers worst-case startup (the 30 s lock-wait + ~5 s of pool
# / procrastinate setup) — the orchestrator won't kill the container
# while it's still legitimately booting.

# Worker runs as root because the bind-mounted /var/run/docker.sock is
# owned by the host's docker group, whose GID isn't predictable across
# host OSes (0 on Docker Desktop, 999 or 998 on most Linux distros).
# Adding the `aios` user to a fixed-GID group inside the image would
# work on one host class and silently break on another; root sidesteps
# that by virtue of being root. The sandbox containers root spawns are
# the actual workload-execution surface — they run inside their own
# host-level docker namespaces and inherit the sandbox image's runtime
# user (currently root from `python:3.13-slim`; tightening that is
# tracked separately).
