    """Purge Account

     Hard-delete a direct child that has already been soft-archived.

    T2 decision (#1463): ``purge`` is deliberately retained as the
    explicitly-named two-step hard-delete ceremony (it refuses unless the
    account is already archived, childless, and resourceless). It is *not*
    renamed to ``delete_account`` — under the T2 convention the bare DELETE
    verb is the soft-archive, and ``/purge`` is the consistent name for the
    irreversible hard-delete across families. accounts is the baseline here.

    Two-step ceremony:     1. ``DELETE /v1/accounts/{id}`` soft-archives (sets ``archived_at``).    2.
    ``POST /v1/accounts/{id}/purge`` hard-deletes the row.

    ``mode=strict`` is the legacy default: it refuses populated accounts and
    allows any direct parent. ``mode=cascade`` is root-only and durably erases
    a childless direct child's database resources and canonical host artifacts;
    exact retries resume a stored cleanup receipt after partial failure.
